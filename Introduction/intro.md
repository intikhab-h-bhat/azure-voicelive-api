# What is the Voice live API?

- The Voice live API is a tool that makes it easier for developers to build apps where people can talk naturally with AI in real time. Instead of setting up separate systems for listening (speech recognition), thinking (AI responses), and talking back (text-to-speech), this API combines them all into one streamlined service.

 **In simple words:**
- It’s like giving your app a “ready-to-use brain and voice,” so it can hear what someone says, understand it, and reply with spoken words instantly—without needing extra setup or separate tools.
