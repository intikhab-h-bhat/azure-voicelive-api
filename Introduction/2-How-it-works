How it works
The Voice live API is fully managed, eliminating the need for customers to handle backend orchestration or component integration. 
Developers provide audio input and receive audio output, avatar visuals, and action triggersâ€”all with minimal latency. 
You don't need to deploy or manage any generative AI models, as the API handles all the underlying infrastructure.
